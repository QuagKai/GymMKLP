        <h1 class="Heading_format"><strong>1.Team Name</strong></h1>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Our team name MKLP ,which is a combination of the names of every member of our group (Minh, Khai, Long and Phat), is a special and individual approach to express our team and our own identities. We may bring you a sense of cohesion and togetherness while respecting the uniqueness of each team member by integrating our names into a single, unified unit. </p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;The importance of inclusivity and diversity within our team is demonstrated by the fact that our team name contains the names of every member of the group. It recognizes the significance of each person's contribution as well as the importance of having a variety of experiences and points of view. Although we are not the same age, we can work well under circumstances.</p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Our team name is not only significant to us individually and collectively, but it also helps us stand out in the crowded fields of business and academia. It is a distinctive and memorable method for us to represent who we are and what we do, and it aids in building our reputation and brand.</p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Overall, our team name is a representation of our unity, diversity, and dedication to our common objectives rather than merely a collection of names. We are motivated and inspired by it, which makes it easier for us to collaborate well and succeed.</p>

        <p class="Body_format">Contact number: 0812888246.</p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Interest in topic: I regularly go to the gym and use my free time to practice soft skills like cooking and self-learning. I picked up cooking so I could manage the calories and nutrients in my food. Additionally, visiting the gym helps me live a healthy lifestyle.

        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Relevant skills: Logical Thinking, Well-Organized, Self-Learning and Adaptability, Python</p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Role in this project: I designed the website, specifically, the Machine sale page.

On top of that, I represented the whole group to write the Overview, Group Processes and Testing.</p>
        
        <h1 class="Heading_format"><strong>3.Group Processes</strong></h1>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;In this project, our group has made an outstanding effort to complete this assignment because we have done our best to keep in touch with each other and we also persuade our teammates to accomplish their tasks before our mini deadlines. On top of that, we divided the tasks equally for everyone. Therefore, finishing all tasks before our mini deadlines was no longer doubtful. Because this semester is the first time we have collaborated with each other, there were some obstacles that we faced. Last but not least, we hope to have more opportunities to collaborate as a team. Therefore, we can improve our skills as well as our performance.</p>

        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;A common element among our career plans is the desire to work in the field of Information Technology. Each person has chosen this major at RMIT and is interested in pursuing a career in a related field. We would have to take step by step by gaining experience and continuing to learn in order to improve our skills, advance careers and achieve our goals. </p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;There are also some differences between these career plans. Minh's career plan involves becoming a data scientist and specializing in topics such as data structures, that involves using data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. While Khai is more interested in web development and software engineering which involves designing and building websites and software applications. Khai is particularly interested in personalizing services and products, and believes that artificial intelligence and machine learning will be key to achieving this goal. Phat's career plan involves working as a website developer and he recognizes the value of experience in this field. Therefore, he plans to work in this role to gain more knowledge and eventually earn a new degree to improve his chances of career advancement. Long is interested in frontend development, which involves designing and building the user interface of websites. He is attracted to the creative aspect of this role and plans to apply for full-time or freelance jobs in this field and potentially transition into teaching. These differences reflect the unique interests and goals of each person in the group.</p>
        <p class="Body_format">&emsp;Overall, the career plans of this group are somewhat similar, as we all involve working in the field of Information Technology. However, there are also some differences in terms of specific job roles and areas of focus.</p>
